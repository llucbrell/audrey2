## View Control for Command Line Interface

When we build a CLI (Command Line Interface) we can find some troubles. While the software stays small it's easy to mantain and work with it. But as much a it grows... It could be a work for something out of space.


Click this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) if you'r interested in the MVC architecture style that Audrey want to apply.


## Specifications

This code try to complement other CLI tools like commander, etc., to implement the MVC over terminal apps.
If you bind Audrey with this tools you can get a complete functional controller.
Commander and others update the model. Audrey give you the power of update view/s in several ways.. 

Audrey it's build as a nodeJS module, precisely as an clousure object factory. In that way, Audrey doesn't inffer in the code of your app.


Version 1 is now deprecated.

Version two of Audrey introduce the concepts of seed and scions. In that way, now audrey-two is **more flexible and customizable**.


## What it does? 

Feed Audrey with object errors and data extracted from your command actions. This carnivorous plant get charge of the output console display and give to your users a little of sugar rather than only an ugly output option. 

You can combine lots of views by passing them to audrey. So you get more control of what you display and the way you do. Of course, using audrey, you don't need to think so much about code-flow.


If you feed Audrey with a header, body, footer & data for displaying... 
It'll grow big and strong!

## Install v2.0

Example
```
$ npm install --save audrey-two
```

## Usage

Example
```js
var audrey2= require('audrey-two');
var audrey= audrey2(myTerminalDisplay);

//run your command and pass error objects to audrey

audrey.feed("viewName", objectView);
//if it's and error code start with "E"
audrey.err("E02", "You'll be a deeeentist...");
//Warnings Start in "W"
audrey.err("W01", "A plant from out Space!");
//you can show success on the console too
audrey.err("S001", "I'm Alive!");
//or pass some auxiliar to print in the same line
adrey.err("S002", "This is a new kind of plant!", cli.name);
audrey.encore();
```

## Printing

With Audrey you can print in different ways.
You can print all the view, as if you click on a link. The browser load the web-page at once. 

Example
```js
var audrey2= require('audrey-two');
var audrey= audrey2(myTerminalDisplay);

//run your command and pass error objects to audrey

audrey.feed("FeedMe", objectViewFeed);
audrey.feed("Seymour", objectVSeymour);

audrey.encore(); //--> print the last replanted view
//print--> the objectSeymour

audrey.sing("FeedMe"); //--> print the view with the name
//print--> objectFeedMe
```

Audrey doesn't print nothing untill "adrey.encore()" or "sing()" method is called. And then everything it's printed with your custom choices. 
Audrey has two methods to inject data. As if it was "console.log()" printing into the body. Or by assignation of the values in the custom-object (view). Look at customization for details. 

Example
```js
//write on the same line
audrey.write(data);
//write on different line samea as console.log
audrey.writeLine(data);
```

## Debug mode... turn off!

You can not execute the error debugger by passing a boolean false to the method. By this method, audrey only print the header, the body and the footer if you include some. It xcludes the execution of error list. This option is good for make --verbose cli option for your apps. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llucbrell/audrey2/master/captura.png)

Example
```js
audrey.debug(false);
``` 

## Custom Object

This is the view of the MVC. You can customize almoust everything in Audrey View. The view is divided, as a basic HTML does. 

>Header 

>Body

>Footer

You must use this parts to organize your view. Include name components inside this arrays and define them outside using their name without the taggy.

Look at this terminal options defined before send it to Audrey.

Example
```js
var terminal-view={ 
          header: [ ">Title" , "%symbol"],
          brand: "this is Audrey2",
          copyright: "MIT Seymour",
          symbolProgress: "o",
          colors:{ 
           brand: "red", 
           copyright: chalk.blue}         
        };
}
```

## View Components

Audrey has some basic components to give you some custom options. Every component is more or less as if it was a tag. They have a reserved characther (taggy) at the beggining of each string. You have to include this taggies into the header, body and footer's array or audrey will not see them.

Example
```js
var view= 
{header:[">brand",">brand2","?advise"]
 body:["%errorsBar"],
 footer:["&mycopyright"]}
```

## Components

1. &gt;mystrings: "string" | any string
2. &copyright: "string" | get two or more words. First, license's name and then the author, add the copyright symbol 
4. ?info: "string" | change color of the string with the errors
5. %symbolProgress:  "string" | change color symbol with errors you can use it as jasmine/mocha error checker
6. ~change: ["three","srting","array"] | three strings that change if there are errors or not. If it's not a color defined uses the success, warning, error colors.
7. #table: {array:[["array","of", "arrays"]["each", "array", "for"]["each", "line.", "Colors"]["only", "with", "chalk"]], align: ["letter", "for", "column"]}

Alignment types:

* `'l'` - left
* `'r'` - right
* `'c'` - center
* `'.'` - decimal

## Colors

If you want to add colors to your view, you only have to add a property colors with an object of whatever component you want to color.

Example
```js
  var view= 
 {header:[">brand",">brand2","?advise"]
  body:["%errorsBar"],
  footer:["&mycopyright"],
  colors:{
  brand: "red",
  advise: "green"
  }}
```

Example
```js
  var red= "red";  //other colors as green
  view.colors.advise= red;
```
Audrey also gives you chalk suport colors. But you have to install this module or node will bring you an error.

Example
```js
  var chalk= require('chalk');
  var red= chalk.red.bold.underline;
  view.colors.advise= red;
```

## Dependencies

Audrey-two make use of...


* [text-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-table) module for a correct table display.
  
* [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) module for the color display.

* [string-length](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-length) module for the color display.


People and plants really appreciate your great code!
